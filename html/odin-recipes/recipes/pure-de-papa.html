    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a lot like a Shepherd's Pie with a little Latin flair. Good comfort food.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 cups potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, or to taste</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 onion, diced</li>
      <li>2 tomatoes, diced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons shredded panquehue cheese</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2-quart
        baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring
        to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender,
        about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Mash
        the hot potatoes with butter and salt. Let cool until just warm; stir in
        the beaten egg until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the
        garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned
        translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and tomato paste;
        continue cooking until the tomatoes soften and begin to lose their
        shape. Add the ground beef and cook until browned, about 10 minutes.
        Stir in the panquehue cheese and parsley; season to taste with salt,
        black pepper, and cayenne pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread half of the mashed potato mixture into the prepared baking dish.
        Cover with the ground beef mixture, then spread the remaining mashed
        potatoes over the beef to completely cover.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are hot and the top is
        lightly browned, about 40 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
