    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Everyone who knows my grandma loves her Milanesa empanizada (breaded
      Milanese). I learned how to cook thanks to her, and when I was 7 years old
      I learned how to cook this Milanesa de res recipe. I consider this recipe
      a basic on Mexican cuisine. You're gonna love it! You can serve this with
      French fries, rice, refried beans, or a salad (we use lettuce, tomato,
      avocado, and cucumber slices with a twist of lemon). Corn or flour
      tortillas go great with all this.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large eggs, or more as needed</li>
      <li>4 thin slices boneless round steak</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>40 saltine crackers, smashed</li>
      <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Crack eggs in a medium bowl and beat slightly with a fork or whisk. Set
        aside. Place smashed crackers on a plate big enough for the steak.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season steak with salt and pepper and soak in the beaten egg. Transfer
        to the smashed crackers and cover both sides with the crackers using a
        spoon; you can press a little bit with the spoon so that the crackers
        stick better.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a frying pan over medium heat and add enough oil to cover the
        bottom half of the steaks. Cook 2 steaks in the hot oil until crackers
        have turned light golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn and continue to cook until golden and meat is no longer pink, 4 to
        5 minutes more. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess
        oil. Repeat with remaining steaks.
      </li>
